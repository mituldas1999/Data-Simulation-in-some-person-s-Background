# Data Simulation and Visualization

This project involves simulating data for a person's background and creating various visualizations to analyze the simulated data. The data includes attributes such as name, age, location, state, country, education, passing year, and blood group.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to create a synthetic dataset that mimics real-world data and to generate visual reports based on the simulated data. This can be useful for testing algorithms, training models, and conducting research without using sensitive or personally identifiable information.

## Data Simulation

The dataset is simulated with the following attributes for each person:

- **Name:** A randomly selected name from a predefined list.
- **Age:** A randomly generated age between 22 and 35.
- **Location:** A randomly selected city from a predefined list.
- **State:** Corresponding state for the selected city.
- **Country:** Country of the person (e.g., USA).
- **Education:** Randomly selected education level from a predefined list.
- **Passing Year:** A randomly generated year between 2009 and 2020.
- **Blood Group:** A randomly selected blood group from a predefined list.

## Visualizations

Several visualizations are created to analyze the simulated data:

1. **Correlation Heatmap:**
